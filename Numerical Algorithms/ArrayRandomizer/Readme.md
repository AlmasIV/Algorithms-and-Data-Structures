## Steps

1. Select the index of any element in the array.
2. Select another random index of any element in the array.
3. Swap the elements of previously selected indexes.
4. Repeat the previous steps several times.

Recommendation use `for` loop. Repeat `N` time, where `N` is the length of an array.
